# Virtual Charcoal

This is an app I wrote when I was just starting out as a developer. It's based on those old Tamagotchi/virtual pet games. Charcoal was the name of a pet cat I had at the time. 
He was a very intelligent and sweet cat, and is deeply misssed. :(

This was written in VB5 and isn't exactly my best work, but I was just starting out as a developer at the time.
